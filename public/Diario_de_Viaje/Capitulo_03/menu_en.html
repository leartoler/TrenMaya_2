        <p class="description">Travel Journal</p>
            <p class="details">The Yucatán Peninsula has been the subject of narratives for hundreds of years. 
            At least since the 16th century, reports of the territory appeared in the chronicles of conquest. 
            Over time, various travelers have shared their experiences and encounters in the Maya region through travel journals, chronicles, or literary texts.
            These writings popularized the fascination with the everyday life of the places they visited, and especially with the remains of the ancient Maya.
            Their journeys documented many places that, until not long ago, were inaccessible.
            The train route now allows contemporary travelers to have their own experiences in places that were once unreachable and known only through the accounts of early explorers who ventured into the Yucatán Peninsula.
            This exhibition allows us to learn about many aspects of Maya culture through pieces discovered during the construction of the Maya Train, which was accompanied at all times by archaeological salvage efforts that meticulously recorded each element found along the way</p>
